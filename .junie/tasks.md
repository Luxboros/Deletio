# Debt Annihilator Calculatorâ€”Task List

This project is broken down into four main phases: Setup, UI Development,
Calculation Logic, and Finalization.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup

- [x] Initialize a new project in your chosen framework (e.g., create a new
  Android Studio project for a Kotlin app)
- [x] Set up the basic file structure (e.g., main activity, layout file)

---

## Phase 2: User Interface (UI)

### Input Fields

- [x] Add a text input for "Loan Total" (accepts numbers/currency)
- [x] Add a text input for "Monthly Payment" (accepts numbers/currency)
- [x] Add a text input for "Interest Rate" (accepts numbers/percentage)

### Action Button

- [x] Add a "Calculate" button

### Output Display

- [x] Add a text view to display the "Payoff Date"
- [x] Add a text view to display the "Total Interest Paid"

---

## Phase 3: Calculation Logic

- [x] Create a function that takes loanTotal, monthlyPayment, and interestRate
  as arguments
- [x] Inside the function, calculate the monthly interest rate from the annual
  rate
- [x] Implement a loop that subtracts the monthly payment from the loan balance
  and adds the calculated interest each month
- [x] Keep a running total of interest paid
- [x] Count the number of months until the loan balance is zero or less
- [x] Convert the total months into a future date to find the "Payoff Date"
- [x] Return the calculated payoffDate and totalInterestPaid

---

## Phase 4: Integration & Finalization

- [x] Connect the "Calculate" button to the calculation function
- [x] Pass the values from the input fields to the function
- [x] Take the results from the function and display them in the corresponding
  output text views
- [x] Perform basic input validation (e.g., ensure inputs are not empty and are
  valid numbers)
- [x] Test the app with different values to ensure accuracy
- [ ] Project Complete
